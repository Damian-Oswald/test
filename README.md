# Loading and editing a JSON file in a browser

[This program](https://damian-oswald.github.io/test) allows you to load a JSON file from a private repository, change it in place and save the changes. This will trigger a GitHub commit in the background.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You'll need read and write permission to this repository in order to be able to follow through with this workflow. Also, a valid GitHub authentication token is required.
